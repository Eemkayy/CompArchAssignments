# CompArchAssignments
This is the code that I wrote for the different assignments I was tasked with while taking the Computer Architecture course at Rutgers University (01:198:211). Solution code can be found in the src folder, structured as indicated in the PDF file.

The code is written in C and Makefile is used to simplify the process of compilation and execution. Python is provided from the graders to automate the grading process of our code and return error messages if the code is incorrect.

Folder pa1:
PA1 is based off of 6 various assignments which give a new C-coder a glimpse of what C is. Varying from mere character manipulations to creating a BST, it prepares the coder for what's to come.
