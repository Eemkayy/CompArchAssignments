# CompArchAssignments
This is the code that I wrote for the different assignments I was tasked with while taking the Computer Architecture course at Rutgers University (01:198:211)

Folder pa1:
PA1 is based off of 6 various assignments which give a new C-coder a glimpse of what C is. Varying from mere character manipulations to creating a BST, it prepares the coder for what's to come.
