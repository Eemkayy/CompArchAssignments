# CompArchAssignments
This is the code that I wrote for the different assignments I was tasked with while taking the Computer Architecture course at Rutgers University (01:198:211). Solution code can be found in the src folder, structured as indicated in the PDF file.

The code is written in C and Makefile is used to simplify the process of compilation and execution. Python is provided from the graders to automate the grading process of our code and return error messages if the code is incorrect.

Folder pa1:
PA1 is based off of 6 various assignments which give a new C-coder a glimpse of what C is. Varying from mere character manipulations to creating a BST, it prepares the coder for what's to come.
More details can be found in the pa1.pdf file.

Folder pa2:
PA2 focuses on "Machine-Learning", where we are doing continuous matrix multiplications to achieve a "Weight" matrix that is applied to some house's parmeters in order to calculate the price of each one of them.
The user is given the input files and is tasked to work with them in order to achieve the desired result.
More details can be found in the pa2.pdf file.

pa3:
Assignment 3 can be found in the bomblab16 folder in my profile in a separate repository. It has been added in a separate repository since this one focuses primarily on C whereas the bomb lab is mainly understanding Assembly.
